I went to Police station and they took a report I ask them to investigate but they did not find the criminal I send the report to credit bureau and XXXX and XXXX deleted the Wrong information but equifax did not. 
"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, OH XXXX DOB XXXX SS XXXX My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX please delete any and all variations of my name they are not accurate.

"I ordered some clothing online, two purchases in the amounts of {$140.00} & {$81.00} The merchandise was never delivered to my home. The packages is missing. I have e-mailed several times with no response to customer service and disputed the charge on their website. For two weeks no response. I have no merchandise and can't get a refund."
Credit Bureaus told me that XXXX XXXX have verified that the current status is correct. However this is not the case. Simply providing me with a computer generated document is no enough proof that I was late. I request for a copy of my payments with XXXX XXXX to verify what they is indeed correct but they did not provide it. CFPB please reverse the late payments on XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX
"During an application for a car loan, I discovered that there were many errors in my Credit Reports with all XXXX credit bureaus ( XXXX ; XXXX ; and TransUnion Consumer Solutions ). I respectfully sent a request letter to them to investigate, delete, and forward me the names and phone others of all the people they contact, any documentation as well as a new Credit Report within 30 days per Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

To my dismay and surprise, I have not received any documentation evidence as stated in all my XXXX letters I sent to all XXXX credit bureaus ( XXXX ; XXXX ; and TransUnion Consumer Solutions ). 
I feel it is an intentional action by these credit bureaus to gain from the errors in other peoples credit reports so that we as consumers can pay for very high interest loans as I am paying now. Per Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) reuglations they are supposed to investigate any errors and notify me if these have been done. 
I am about to file a law suit against all the credit bureaus ( XXXX ; XXXX ; and TransUnion Consumer Solutions ) ; and before I do that I report it to XXXX."
"On XX/XX/XXXX, I made an ACH payment of {$830.00} to my MasterCard with Bank of America. I received email confirmation of the payment on XX/XX/XXXX from Bank of America.This was for a payment due in advance of the statement due date for previous month 's entire balance. "
"I signed up for a 7-day trial with Transunion. However, they charged a {$26.00} Subscription Fee for 3-Burea Credit Monitoring on XX/XX/2020 without my consent, and without providing the the service reporting."
"On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to deposit {$1300.00} ( XXXX XXXX dollars ) into my personal checking account at Citizens Bank  five minutes after the branch had closed. The ATM could not complete my transaction and would not return my cash, instead issuing me a slip that told me to contact my financial institution ( as attached ). I saw an employee still in the building and knocked on the door. He saw my struggles and told me that their software has been recently updated and had led to many ATM peoples for multiple people. He also advised me to call the number. 

I immediately called Citizens Bank 's customer service number and filed a claim with them for the missing money. I was given the claim number XXXX ( as attached ) and I was told I would hear back in 7-10 business days. 

On the following Tuesday ( XXXX XXXX ), I visited the branch and told them what happened over the weekend. They advised me that the ATM company picks up the money on Wednesdays and they would call me to let me know when the money was found. I left my name, number, and all incident information with the teller. 

On the eighth business day ( XXXX XXXX ), I went to the branch to deposit money and asked about my claim as I had received no notification or even acknowledgment thus far. The teller advised me to wait a few more days and that it would probably be posted soon. 

Today, XXXX XXXX ( 12 business days later ), I went into the branch again and asked about my claim. The teller finally pulled me aside and contacted their claims department personally for me. The teller then advised me that my claim had been denied and the matter was now closed within their company. They told me I was notified of this on XX/XX/XXXX, but I received nothing and had no idea about this."
"Account number : XXXX On XX/XX/2019 someone walked into a Bank of America branch in Florida and withdrew {$3400.00} from my account. It is showing on bank statement as check # XXXX. 
Bank of America gave this person, not me or my wife, these funds. 
This is an identity theft or a mishandling of accounts by Bank of America giving funds to a person who is not who they say they are, theft. 
Called the bank immediately about this unauthorized withdrawal as I was not in Florida but in my home in Connecticut at the time of this transaction. Bank of America said it is an identity theft problem and we need to file a Police report. 
Police report filed, sent to Bank of America ( BofA ) and B of A said we would be reimbursed on receipt of Police Report. I have NOT received any funds, return of {$3400.00} and my enquiries to B of A are falling on deaf ears. Need the to return my {$3400.00}"
